	/**
	 * this class provides the tool version written in the output EXCEL file
	 * it contains also a TODO list
	 * 
	 * list of known problems:
	 * ======================
	 * 
	 * in the trace-ability tab, if the file name - file path is too long 
	 * there is no horizontal scroll bar to see the complete file path in the different tables showing the
	 * the upstream and downstream files
	 * 
	 * in the output EXCEL file, the file path at the top should be an hyper link 
	 * in order to be able to click on it and open directly the file
	 * 
	 * there should be a mean (a button associated to a folder chooser) 
	 * to select the path where EXCEL results files are generated.
	 * This output path could also be configurable in the configuration file
	 *
